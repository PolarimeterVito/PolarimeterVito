## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a Senior Scientist in the Optical Metrology Group led by Oliver H. Heckl at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Vienna. Our research focus is on precision measurements using optical frequency combs as a tool to "interrogate" molecules.
If you are interested in our research, check out our [homepage](https://optical-metrology.univie.ac.at/).
For my personal publication record I would also love you to check out my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1420-7948) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=6pKGfmwAAAAJ).

A big part of my everyday work life is using code to understand, interpret and visualize data as well as to automatize processes like complex measurement algorithms. I have started using GitHub recently to get a better structure and proper versioning for my code -- I am still learning and looking forward to improving both my work and my skills!
